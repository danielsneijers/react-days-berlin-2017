# React Days Berlin 2017 Exercises
This repo contains all the exercises for the workshop "**Scale your React App for your first Million Users**" at the React Days Berlin. To make sure everything goes super smooth if you're attending this workshop it's recommended that you clone this repository and install it's dependencies before the start of the workshop.

## Install and run
To run these exercises, make sure you have a laptop running **Node.js version 8** or higher (pro tip: use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script), it's awesome). To install everything just run:

```
npm install
```

And to run one of the exercises:

```
npm start
```

This'll show you a list of all the available exercises. Pick one and it'll open in your browser so you can play with the example app before diving in the code. Hot reloading is available for all exercises so if you tweak the code, results should be instantly visible in the browser.

## Running tests
To make sure you came up with a working solution you can run the tests.

```
npm test
```

This again will show you a list of all the available exercises. Pick one and it'll run the tests for that exercise in watch mode. The tests will run after each change until you cancel the watch mode with `ctrl + c`.
